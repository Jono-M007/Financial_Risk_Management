# Financial Risk Management Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of projects related to Financial Risk Management, developed as part of my studies in Financial Risk Management (Part 2). 
These projects aim to provide practical insights into various aspects of risk management using R. Each project is designed to tackle specific challenges in the field, ranging from market risk to credit risk and operational risk. 
The projects include detailed analyses, simulations, and visualizations to help understand and mitigate financial risks effectively.


## Key Objectives:
•	Understanding Risk Metrics: Learn how to calculate and interpret key risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall, and Stress Testing results.

•	Modeling Techniques: Explore different statistical and machine learning techniques for risk modelling, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.

•	Scenario Analysis: Perform scenario and sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of various economic conditions on a portfolio.

•	Practical Implementation: Gain hands-on experience with R programming to implement risk management models and simulations.
